  Abstract                 = {The science of spatial fisheries management, which combines ecology, oceanography, and economics, has matured significantly. As a result, there have been recent advances in exploiting spatially explicit data to develop spatially explicit management policies, such as networks of marine protected areas ({MPAs}). However, when data are sparse, spatially explicit policies become less viable, and we must instead rely on blunt policies such as total allowable catches or imprecisely configured networks of {MPAs}. Therefore, spatial information has the potential to change management approaches and thus has value. We develop a general framework within which to analyze the value of information for spatial fisheries management and apply that framework to several {US} Pacific coast fisheries. We find that improved spatial information can increase fishery value significantly (\textgreater10\% in our simulations), and that it changes dramatically the efficient management approach-switching from diffuse effort everywhere to a strategy where fishing is spatially targeted, with some areas under intensive harvest and others closed to fishing. Using all available information, even when incomplete, is essential to management success and may as much as double fishery value relative to using (admittedly incorrect) assumptions commonly invoked.},

  Abstract                 = {Fewer protected areas exist in the pelagic ocean than any other ecosystem on Earth. Although there is increasing support for marine protected areas ({MPAs}) as a tool for pelagic conservation, there have also been numerous criticisms of the ecological, logistical and economic feasibility of place-based management in the dynamic pelagic environment. Here we argue that recent advances across conservation, oceanography and fisheries science provide the evidence, tools and information to address these criticisms and confirm {MPAs} as defensible and feasible instruments for pelagic conservation. Debate over the efficacy of protected areas relative to other conservation measures cannot be resolved without further implementation of {MPAs} in the pelagic ocean.},

It was found that management of fisheries through reserves and management through effort control produce identical yields under a reasonable set of simplifying assumptions corresponding to a broad range of biological conditions. Indeed, for populations with sedentary adults (invertebrates and reef fishes), reserves have important advantages for sustainability, making marine reserves the preferred management approach.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing focus around the world on marine spatial planning, including spatial fisheries management. Some spatial management approaches are quite blunt, as when marine protected areas ({MPAs}) are established to restrict fishing in specific locations. Other management tools, such as zoning or spatial user rights, will affect the distribution of fishing effort in a more nuanced manner. Considerable research has focused on the ability of {MPAs} to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform {MPAs} has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed {MPAs} can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal {MPA}-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing {MPAs}, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random {MPA} designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.},

  Abstract                 = {The world's oceans are governed as a system of over 150 sovereign exclusive economic zones ({EEZs}, ‚àº42\% of the ocean) and one large high seas ({HS}) commons (‚àº58\% of ocean) with essentially open access. Many high-valued fish species such as tuna, billfish, and shark migrate around these large oceanic regions, which as a consequence of competition across {EEZs} and a global race-to-fish on the {HS}, have been over-exploited and now return far less than their economic potential. We address this global challenge by analyzing with a spatial bioeconomic model the effects of completely closing the {HS} to fishing. This policy both induces cooperation among countries in the exploitation of migratory stocks and provides a refuge sufficiently large to recover and maintain these stocks at levels close to those that would maximize fisheries returns. We find that completely closing the {HS} to fishing would simultaneously give rise to large gains in fisheries profit (\textgreater100\%), fisheries yields (\textgreater30\%), and fish stock conservation (\textgreater150\%). We also find that changing {EEZ} size may benefit some fisheries; nonetheless, a complete closure of the {HS} still returns larger fishery and conservation outcomes than does a {HS} open to fishing.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to fostering biodiversity goals, marine protected area ({MPA}) implementation has economic consequences for both commercial and recreational fisheries. During the implementation of the State of California ({USA}) Marine Life Protection Act ({MLPA}), which mandates the creation of an {MPA} network in California's state waters, the stakeholders and policymakers utilized a pair of economic analyses that addressed these considerations. One was a comparative, static assessment of short-term, \textquotedblleftworst case\textquotedblright potential socioeconomic impacts to important fisheries based on surveys of local fishermen. This analysis made no assumptions about fishery management outside of {MPAs}, assumed no spillover of fish from {MPAs} into fished areas or reallocation of fishing effort, and estimated the maximum potential dollar-value economic impacts over a short time scale. The other was a dynamic, bioeconomic assessment of the changes in spatial distribution of biomass and catch, based on published biological parameter values, oceanographic models of larval connectivity, and a range of possible levels of fishing. This analysis explicitly accounted for fish population dynamics, spillover, fisher movement, and fishery management outside of the {MPAs}, but was limited to long-term, equilibrium-based results because of a lack of baseline abundance data. Both evaluation methods were novel in their spatial resolution and their use directly in an {MPA} design process, rather than after implementation. The two methods produced broadly similar (at a regional spatial scale) evaluations of the likely effects of proposed {MPAs} on fisheries, at least when the bioeconomic model assumed fishery management was conservative. Our experience with these analyses in the {MLPA} Initiative process led to several suggestions for future {MPA} design efforts: (i) since the change in fish biomass inside {MPAs} partly depends on fisheries management outside of them, it is useful to integrate or coordinate conventional fishery management and {MPA} planning efforts; (ii) integrate modeling assessments early into {MPA} design, as part of a post-implementation adaptive management approach; and (iii) integrate empirical fishery data into bioeconomic models in order to improve representations of human behavior and short-term forecasts of changes in fished populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Concentrations of biodiversity, or hotspots, represent conservation priorities in terrestrial ecosystems but remain largely unexplored in marine habitats. In the open ocean, many large predators such as tunas, sharks, billfishes, and sea turtles are of current conservation concern because of their vulnerability to overfishing and ecosystem role. Here we use scientific-observer records from pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to show that oceanic predators concentrate in distinct diversity hotspots. Predator diversity consistently peaks at intermediate latitudes (20-30 degrees N and S), where tropical and temperate species ranges overlap. Individual hotspots are found close to prominent habitat features such as reefs, shelf breaks, or seamounts and often coincide with zooplankton and coral reef hotspots. Closed-area models in the northwest Atlantic predict that protection of hotspots outperforms other area closures in safeguarding threatened pelagic predators from ecological extinction. We conclude that the seemingly monotonous landscape of the open ocean shows rich structure in species diversity and that these features should be used to focus future conservation efforts.},

abstract = {{US}-based philanthropies have long contributed to environmental conservation through non-repayable donations, but some are now beginning to embrace novel investment strategies that are profit-orientated. From the vantage points of political economy and geopolitics, this article investigates the potential ramifications of this shift in funding for large-scale marine protected areas ({LMPAs}), which have been widely promoted to enhance marine biodiversity and manage sustainable fisheries. Specific attention is given to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area ({PIPA}) in Kiribati, where finance from {US}-based philanthropic foundations is intended to support the operation and management of the {LMPA} and eventually compensate the government for forgone revenues from fishing licences, via the creation of a trust fund. Content analysis of key documents is conducted to empirically trace the political, legal, and financial evolution of {PIPA}. The findings demonstrate how, in accepting finance from philanthropic foundations, the government of Kiribati gradually relinquishes its decision-making leverage over {PIPA}'s territory and resources. Hence, it is contended that certain legal and financial provisions could act as under-acknowledged and purposive drivers of \textquoteleftocean-control grabbing\textquoteright. Results further reveal that achieving financial sustainability for the {PIPA} conservation trust fund has proven difficult, opening up discussions on the extent to which {PIPA} could be capitalised in other ways. More broadly, the paper engages with recent debates on for-profit conservation, ocean grabbing, and the blue economy.}

abstract = {Fisheries management faces numerous monitoring and enforcement challenges that are becoming more complex as fish stocks are depleted; and illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing becomes more sophisticated. For remote island nations, the challenges are compounded by a loosely understood association of pelagic stocks to the ocean environment, and the tyranny of distance in monitoring and surveilling large exclusive economic zones ({EEZ}). An approach to ocean conservation is establishing protected areas, with the Pacific island nation of Palau as a leader with the recently established National Marine Sanctuary, which closes 80\% of their {EEZ} to commercial fishing in 2020. Here we present an {EEZ}-wide analysis of Palau commercial fishing over a 6-year period (2011-2016), and develop a system for predicting fishing activity accounting for oceanic variables, climate indices, and vessel flag. Linking pelagic habitat to fishing activity provides high-resolution decision aids for management, highlighting the need for {EEZ}-specific analyses in addressing fisheries.}

Although poor fisheries governance is often implicated, evaluation of solutions remains rare. Bioeconomic theory and case studies suggest that rights-based catch shares can provide individual incentives for sustainable harvest that is less prone to collapse. To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.}

abstract = {Food security remains a principal challenge in the developing tropics where communities rely heavily on marine-based protein. While some improvements in fisheries management have been made in these regions, a large fraction of coastal fisheries remain unmanaged, mismanaged, or use only crude input controls. These quasi-open-access conditions often lead to severe overfishing, depleted stocks, and compromised food security. A possible fishery management approach in these institution-poor settings is to implement fully protected marine protected areas ({MPAs}). Although the primary push for {MPAs} has been to solve the conservation problems that arise from mismanagement, {MPAs} can also benefit fisheries beyond their borders. The literature has not completely characterized how to design {MPAs} under diverse ecological and economic conditions when food security is the objective. We integrated four key biological and economic variables (i.e., fish population growth rate, fish mobility, fish price, and fishing cost) as well as an important aspect of reserve design ({MPA} size) into a general model and determined their combined influence on food security when {MPAs} are implemented in an open-access setting. We explicitly modeled open-access conditions that account for the behavioral response of fishers to the {MPA}; this approach is distinct from much of the literature that focuses on assumptions of "scorched earth" (i.e., severe over-fishing), optimized management, or an arbitrarily defined fishing mortality outside the {MPA}'s boundaries. We found that the {MPA} size that optimizes catch depends strongly on economic variables. Large {MPAs} optimize catch for species heavily harvested for their high value and/or low harvesting cost, while small {MPAs} or no closure are best for species lightly harvested for their low value and high harvesting cost. Contrary to previous theoretical expectations, both high and low mobility species are expected to experience conservation benefits from protection, although, as shown previously, greater conservation benefits are expected for low mobility species. Food security benefits from {MPAs} can be obtained from species of any mobility. Results deliver both qualitative insights and quantitative guidance for designing {MPAs} for food security in open-access fisheries.}

abstract = {Designated large-scale marine protected areas ({LSMPAs}, 100,000 or more square kilometers) constitute over two-thirds of the approximately 6.6\% of the ocean and approximately 14.5\% of the exclusive economic zones within marine protected areas. Although {LSMPAs} have received support among scientists and conservation bodies for wilderness protection, regional ecological connectivity, and improving resilience to climate change, there are also concerns. We identified 10 common criticisms of {LSMPAs} along three themes: (1) placement, governance, and management; (2) political expediency; and (3) social-ecological value and cost. Through critical evaluation of scientific evidence, we discuss the value, achievements, challenges, and potential of {LSMPAs} in these arenas. We conclude that although some criticisms are valid and need addressing, none pertain exclusively to {LSMPAs}, and many involve challenges ubiquitous in management. We argue that {LSMPAs} are an important component of a diversified management portfolio that tempers potential losses, hedges against uncertainty, and enhances the probability of achieving sustainably managed oceans.}

abstract = {Establishment of tradable water rights could play an important role in improving the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of water use in developing countries. Well-defined tradable rights formalize and secure the existing water rights held by water users; economize on transactions costs; induce water users to consider the full opportunity cost of water; and provide incentives for water users to internalize and reduce many of the negative externalities inherent in irrigation. The institutional requirements, potential and feasibility of developing markets in tradable water rights should receive increased attention from researchers and policy makers.}

abstract = {Discussions of sustainable use have become polarized. Welfarists oppose all use that involves killing animals. Among conservationists polarization arises in part from failure to distinguish between different ideas nestled under the umbrella term of \textquoteleftsustainable use\textquoteright. These include direct use as an imperative or choice, the ideal of keeping any use within biologically sustainable limits, and use as a possible conservation strategy that can create positive incentives, which are key where land could otherwise be converted to biodiversity-unfriendly practices. People will continue to use wild living resources, which increasing human populations could further deplete. In response the conservation community can follow one of two approaches. On the one hand, it can try to stop use through the establishment of strictly protected areas and by enforcing legislation, although many would question the ethical position of imposing such an approach. On the other hand, it can work to introduce the wider management systems needed to deliver sustainable use and, if possible, incentive-driven conservation. Because most rural populations will continue using wild living resources in human-dominated landscapes, sustainable use and incentive-driven conservation should both be at the centre of the conservation agenda this century. Both species- and ecosystem-based management are likely to have a role in sustainable use. However, current enthusiasm for the ecosystem approach may throw up unexpected consequences, making the search for sustainability even more polarized. Nevertheless, direct use of species cannot provide sufficient incentives to ensure the continued delivery of ecosystem services, which need to be fully incorporated in the global accounting system.}
