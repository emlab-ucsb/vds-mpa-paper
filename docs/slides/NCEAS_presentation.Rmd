## Motivation

### Relationship between closure size and losses

Does a 30\% closure mean a 30\% loss in revenue?

# Scope and Approach

## Scope

Can economic instruments incentivize conservation?

- For the countries:

  - What are the costs associated to establishing an MPA?

  - What factors drive these costs?

  - Can these costs be reduced or eliminated?

- For the fishing vessels:

  - How do they respond?

  - Where do they go?


## Approach

- 10-patch model of the tuna purse-seine fishery
  
  - 9 patches under VDS
  - one patch under Open Access

- Profits from fishing in patch $i$ are:

$$\Pi_i(E_i,X_i,R) = pqE_iX_i\Omega_i-cE_i^\beta$$


$$\Omega_1 = \theta + (1 - \theta)(1 - R)$$

- Vessel-day price must equate the marginal profits from the last unit of effort in patches $i = (1, 9)$

$$\pi_i(E_i) = pqX_i\Omega_i- \beta cE_i^{\beta-1}$$

## Approach

- Patch-level effort is then

$$E_i = \left(\frac{pqX_i\Omega_i - \pi_i}{\beta c }\right) ^ { \frac{1}{\beta - 1}}$$

- Effort is capped at 45,000 vessel-days ($\bar{E}$)

$$\bar{E} = \sum_{i = 1}^9\left(\frac{pqX_i\Omega_i - \pi}{\beta c }\right) ^ {\frac{1}{\beta - 1}}$$

## Approach

- Measure country-level demand curves

  - No trading: price is patch-specific
  
  - Trading: price is the same for all patches

# Model predictions

## Model predictions

### Relationship between closure size and losses

Does a 30\% closure mean a 30\% loss in revenue?

## Losses with no trading

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "slides", "img", "cost_no_trading.png"))
```

## Model predictions

### A market for fishing efforts

- What is the effect of trading?

- Can costs be reduced?

## Trading significantly reduces costs

```{r}

```

```

## Allocation rules matter

- Vessel-days are allocated to countries each year

- Combination of biomass and in-EEZ usage

$$
E_i^* = \alpha \left(\frac{\sum_{\tau = 0}^{\hat{\tau}}E_{i,t-\tau}}{\bar{E}\hat{\tau}} \right) +
(1 - \alpha) \left(\frac{\sum_{\tau = 0}^{\hat{\tau}}X_{i,t-\tau}}{\bar{X}\hat{\tau}} \right)
$$

- $\alpha$ is a weight on historical effort ($E_i$) and historical biomass ($B_i$)

What is the importance of allocation rules?

## "*Biomass-based*" allocation reduces costs

```

# PIPA

## What can we learn from PIPA?

PIPA:

- Implemented in January, 2015

- 397,447 $Km^2$

- ~2\% of total PNA area

- ~10\% of fishing activity in PNA

GFW data:

- 313 tuna purse seine vessels that fished in PNA

- 92 Fished both before and after PIPA implementation:

  - 64 Fished within PIPA before implementation

- Devideded into three groups

## Two fleets
