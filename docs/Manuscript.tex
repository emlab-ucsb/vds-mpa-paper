\begin{abstract}
Large-scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs) have seen a significant
increase over the last years. Fishing effort is effectively eliminated
within these protected areas upon implementation. The benefits of
reducing effort have been largely studied, and include increases in
abundance, biomass, and diversity within the bounded regions. These
no-take zones may produce spillover effects, which provide fish for
outside areas. However, the economic and ecological implications of
displacing fishing effort are not yet fully understood. Novel data
products that track fishing effort at the vessel-level allow us to
identify changes in fleet- and vessel-level behavior upon the
implementation of protected areas, as well as how these redistribute.
This papers evaluates the implications of implementing LSMPA, by
evaluating changes in fishing hours, showing that vessels in the
effected region reduce fishing effort after the implementation of PIPA.
Our results are robust to a set of specifications. We also track the
relative spatial allocation of fishing events thorugh time, and identify
that areas closer to PIPA show an increase in relative fishing hourse
due to the displacement of PIPA-fishing vessels. Our results not only
provide an impact evaluation of the effect of LSMPAs on fishing
activity, but provide insights into vessel redistribution dynamics,
which may have ecological and economic implications.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This work identifies the behavioral changes of fishing vessels due to
the implementation of PIPA. Not only can we identify temporal changes in
fishing patterns (\emph{i.e.} time and distance), but also spatial
patterns. Our vessel-level tracks allow us to see where PIPA-fishing
vessels go after the closure, providing empirical insights about the
redistribution of fishing effort after the implementaion of a MPA.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

This section is divided into two main parts. First, we provide a general
description of AIS data and the process of identification of
vessel-level events done by Global Fishing Watch\footnote{Global Fishing
  Watch: \url{globalfishingwatch.org}}. Alongside, we describe the
subset of data that we use for these analyses. When relevant, we also
point out possible shortcommings in the data, or factors that must be
considered in the later analyses. Then we move on to explain our
identification strategy, and the main analyses that we undertake.

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

\subsubsection{AIS data}\label{ais-data}

Automatic Identification Systems are on-board devices intended to
provide at-sea saftey and prevent ship collisions by broadcasting vessel
locations to surrounding vessels. These broadcasted positions can be
recorded by satellites and land-based antenas. GFW uses a neural network
to infer vessel characteristics and whether each broadcasted position
represents a fishing event, thus allowing us to estimate near real-time
fishing events globally since 2012 \citep{kroodsma_2018}. The recent
addition of satellites that can receive AIS signals causes an apparent
increase in the number of broadcasted AIS messages (\emph{i.e.} points)
and therefore fishing hours. The variability in AIS data and ocean
conditions require that temporal trends be taken into account. We do
that by incorporating a series of controls, which are defined in the
following section.

\subsubsection{PIPA data}\label{pipa-data}

Our data contain over 45 million individual AIS messages for 371 purse
seiners and longliners. A total of 233 vessels have fished within PIPA
waters; 217 did so at least once before 2015. However, not all vessels
continued to fish elsewhere after PIPA implementation: 34 vessels have
no recorded AIS messages after 2015\footnote{The 0 missing vessels might
  have exited the fishery, been decomissioned or sold (therefore
  changing their AIS and mmsi), or turned off their AIS transmiters. In
  either case, we are not able to observe these.}, leaving us with 183
vessels that fished inside PIPA before its implementation, and continued
to fish elsewhere afterward. Vessels that fished within PIPA before
implementation might stop fishing afterwards, therefore not being
observable in the post-treatment period. New vessels might have also
entered the fishery after PIPA closure, and were likely not exposed to
the policy intervention in the pre-treatment period. Therefore, we
define our treatment and control groups as follows.

The treatment group contains all vessels (n = 183) that fished within
PIPA at least once before the closure, and that continued to fish
elsewhere afterwards. Vessels in the control group meet al three of the
following conditions: i) Vessels never fished within PIPA waters, ii)
vessels belong to other PNA countries, and iii) vessels have fished in
surrounding areas (\emph{i.e.} PNA-countries' EEZ) before and after PIPA
closure. For each vessel meeting these characteristics, we calculate
their total monthly fishing hours. Figure \ref{fig:baci_strict} provides
a visual representation of the vessel-level streams of fishing events
that make up each group through time. Tables \ref{tab:baci_n_s} and
\ref{tab:baci_h} show the number of vessels following a BACI design, and
fishing hours, respectively. Tables show data grouped by gear
(longlines, purse seines), group (treated, control), and period (before,
after). The relative change in fishing hours (After / Before) is also
shown.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}

The first analysis focuses on identifying the response of fishing
vessels to PIPA closure. Our variables of interests are fishing effort,
indicated by total fishing hours per month, and distance traveled (Km)
on every fishing trip. We compare fishing hours\footnote{And soon,
  distance} before and after the implementation of PIPA using a
Difference-in-Differences approach, where we track the variable of
interest for vessels that used to fish inside PIPA and vessels that
never fished inside PIPA, before and after PIPA implementation. Our
specification is the following:

\[
y_{i,t} = \alpha + \beta_1 Post_t + \beta_2 Treat_i + \beta_3 Post_t \times Treat_i + \mu_1Y_t + \mu_2Y_t^2 + \phi_t + \gamma_i + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]

Where \(y_{i,t}\) is the variable of interest for vessel \(i\) in time
period \(t\). A dummy variable \(Post_i\) takes the value of 0 for all
dates prior to PIPA implementation and a value of 1 por all dates
including and following PIPA implementation. \(Treat_i\) is a dummy
variable indicating whether a vessel belongs to the control
(\(Treat_i = 0\)) or treatment (\(Treat_i = 1\)) group. \(\alpha\) is
the standard intercept, \(\beta_1\) captures the \emph{ex post} change,
\(\beta_2\) captures the difference between treated and control groups,
and \(\beta_3\) is our parameter of interest: de DiD estimate capturing
the treatment effect. Finally, \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\) are coefficients
for a second order polynomial for years (\(Y_t\))\footnote{An earlier
  specification included years as a dummy variable. Such results are
  included in the appendx.}, while \(\phi_t\) and \(\gamma_i\) represent
month-, and flag-level dummies that account for seasonality or
country-level management interventions.

Our second part of the analyses focuses on the redistribution of fishing
effort. In other words, identifying where do vessels that used to fish
inside PIPA go after its establishment. We calculate the monthly
relative distribution of fishing hours by all treated vessels across all
fished EEZs and the high seas. These trends are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:redist_trend_ps} and \ref{fig:redist_trend_ll}, and the
relative change is presented in Table \ref{tab:ba_disp}. EEZs that had
sproadic fishing events were pooled into a group of ``others'', leaving
us with a total of n = 12 and n = 10 spatially defined regions
(\emph{i.e.} EEZs, High Seas, ``other EEZs'') for purse seiners and
longliners, respectively.

To evaluate this change in effort allocation, we regress our variable of
interest, fishing hours, on the interaction between a dummy variable
indicating the policy intervention and a dummy variable for countries,
to obtain the by-country change in proportional allocation of fishing
effort:

\[
y_{i,t} = \alpha + \beta_1Post_t + \beta_2Country_i + \beta3Post_t \times Country_i + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]

Our variable of interest, \(y_{i,t}\) represents the proportion of
fishing hours that country \(i\) receives at time \(t\). \(Post\) also
represents a policy dummy that takes the value of 0 for all dates before
implementation of PIPA, and 1 otherwise. \(Country\) is a dummy variable
for countries, interpreted as individual EEZs, the high seas, and a
group of ``other EEZs''. Our parameter of interest is \(\beta_3\), which
captures the country-level change in proportional fishing effort.

All regression coefficients were estimatedd via ordinary least squares,
and heteroskedastic-robust standard errors were calculated. All analyses
were performed in R version 3.5.1) \citep{rcore_2018}. Raw data and code
used in this work are available on
\href{https://github.com/jcvdav/MPA_displacement}{github}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Our data suggest that purseiners and longliners have different responses
to the implementation of a Large-Scale Marine Protected Area. Fig.
\ref{fig:all_vessels} shows that mean fishing hours for purse seiners
have an abrupt increase, just before January 1st, 2015. This trend is
observed for both treated and control groups. Longliners, however, show
a more stable trend. The number of mmsi codes increases through time.
This can largely be explained by the addition of more satellites, which
increase detectability of vessels. As expected, total fishing hours
follow a similar trend to that of mmsi numbers.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}\label{fig:all_vessels}Fishing hours
and number of vessels by month for all vessels. Vertical dashed line
indicates PIPA closure.}
\end{figure}

Our DiD anaylsis shows that treated purse seiners reduce their fishing
effort after PIPA implementation in the order of 16 hours per month.
This result is robust and significant (\emph{p \textless{} 0.05}) for
all model specifications, with the effect varying between
\(\beta_3 = -16.457\) and \(\beta_3 = -18.709\). Model specifications
that include the year polynomial show lower values for the \(\beta_1\)
coefficient associated to the \(Post_t\) policy dummy, and show positive
and negative values for \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\), the linear and
cuadratic terms, respectively. These effectively represent the patterns
observed in Figure \{fig:all\_vessels\}.

Longliners show a similar pattern of effort reduction. However, the
magnitude of the \(\beta_3\) coefficient is smaller (ranging from
\(\beta_3 = -9.851\) to \(\beta_3 = -14.850\)) and not significant
across all model specifications. This, along with higher standard error
values suggest that longliners have a smaller and more variable response
to the implementation of LSMPAs.

Regressions coefficients for each gear type are shown in Tables
\ref{tab:purse} and \ref{tab:long}. Column (1) presents the DiD
regression with no fixed effects, column (2) includes month fixed
effects, column (3) includes month and the second degree polynomial for
years, and column (4) includes all of the above and country-level fixed
effects.

Recall that to evaluate the redistribution of fishing effort we only
track fishing vessels that belong to the treated group. In this case, we
calculate the prportion of fishing effort allocated every month to each
spatially explicit region outlined by EEZs and the high seas. For purse
seiners, these represent 9 main EEZs, PIPA, the high seas, and a group
of other EEZs. Figure \ref{fig:redist_trend_ps} shows the monthly
relative fishing hours that each region received by all 183 treated
vessels. The top-left pannel shows the change in fishing effort inside
PIPA, including the preemtive fishing and immediate reduction previously
reported \citep{mcdermott_2018}.

The change in the relative allocation fishing effort by purse seiners
increases in eight of the 12 regions after PIPA implementation
\ref{tab:disp_mod}. The largest increase is observed for the I-Kiribati
EEZ, with an average increase of 0.11 (\emph{p \textless{} 0.001}). In
other words, the redistribution of treated vessels caused a 10\%
increase in the \emph{relative} allocation of fishing effort within
I-Kiribati waters. The only decrease is observed for Papua New Guinea,
but the coefficient is not significant. Figure \ref{fig:map_change_ps}
provides a spatial representation of these changes. It is evident that
the increase in relative fishing effort is greater for for regions
closer to PIPA.

\section{Discusion}\label{discusion}

Our findings provide interesting insights into the effect that LSMPAs
can have on vessel behavior and the redistribution of fishing effort.
These collection of results shows that the implementation of PIPA caused
treated vessels to redeuce their fishing hours, and that this effect is
greater for purse seiners. Even though treated vessels fish less, their
relative allocation of fishing hours increased for all other fishing
grouds. This fidnings does not imply that there is more fishing effort,
but rather that each region receives a greater portion of the post-PIPA
fishing effort (which is lower than pre-PIPA). In this section we
discuss the implications of vessel-level reductions in fishing effort
and the increase in relative allocation of the remaining effort through
space. We also provide plausible explanations as to why purse seiners
seem to be more reactive to the spatial closure.

Previous studies on insular environments suggest that vessels move to
distant places, which might be translated as increased costs
\citep{stevenson_2013}. Nevertheless, this study does not use
counterfactuals that could help account for system- or fleet-level
changes that occur through time. Others have used similar
satellite-tracking systems to show that fishing effort accumulates near
the edges ospatial closures, yielding greater catches
\citep{murawski_2005}. Yet, these vessel tracks do not cover the
pre-reserve period, making it difficult identify the contribution of
spatial closures to the observed spatial distribution of fishing
vessels. Recent work by \citet{elahi_2018} identified that total fishing
effort in a focal region where a short-term MPA was implemented showed
little change, likely indicating that fishers redistributed fishing
effort to compensate for the reduction in available space. Our data is
assambled in a similar way, with fishing positions before and after the
implementation of PIPA and vessels grouped into treated and control
groups. Our BACI design, along with our difference-in-differences
analysis allows us to make causal inferences about the effect that large
scale marine protected areas have on fishing effort.

The different responses observed between purse seiners and longliners
might have two possible explanations. It is likely that PIPA did not
contain habitat that longliners would consider optimal. Therefore, the
sporadic fishing events that occurred there are of little importance to
the fleet, and it is unlikely that the implementation of PIPA has an
effect on them. Alternatively, the differences may be due to the nature
of each fishing gear. Purse seiners are often constrained by seafloor
and termocline depth, and often operate in more restricted areas
\citep{kroodsma_2018}. Tuna purse seiners are known to have greater
proportion of null sets (\emph{i.e.} where the purse seine is
effectively casted arround tuna, but no catch is obtained) during El
Niño years, where the termocline deepens in the Eastern Pacific
\citep{dreyfusleon_2015}. On the other hand, longliners may be more
flexible as to where they can deploy their longlines.
\citet{ortuocrespo_2018} evaluated the ecological niche of the pelagic
longline fleet, and suggest that the fleet may be underutilizing the
ocean, meaning that they can easily redistribute elsewhere.
