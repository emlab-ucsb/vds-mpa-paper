\subsection{Model parameterization}

We calibrate our model to loosely match the fishery dynamics observed for the VDS operated by the PNA. The table below contains the values used to parameterize the model.

\subsection{Empirical Analysis}

We observe four characteristics for every vessel: crew size, engine power, vessel length, and tonnage capacity. Figure \ref{fig:balance_density_plot} shows the distribution of these variables for each group of vessels. Table \ref{tab:balance_table} present the mean, and standard deviation of each observable. Group of vessels are similar on observables, and choice to fish inside PIPA before implementation does not appear to be driven by observable characteristics.

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{\label{tab:balance_table}Mean values on observable characteristics by vessel for displaced (n = 64), and non-displaced vessels (n = 254). Numbers in parentheses indicate standard deviation. The last column contains the difference in means (t-scores), with asterisks inicating significant differences as indicated by a two-tailed t-test (* p < 0.1; ** p< 0.05; *** p < 0.01).}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
\hline
Characteristic & Non-displaced & Displaced & Difference\\
\hline
Crew size (n) & 30.46 (6.25) & 26.38 (3.94) & -4.08 (-6.49) ***\\
\hline
Engine Power (KW) & 2559.89 (588.28) & 2983.6 (558.76) & 423.71 (5.36) ***\\
\hline
Length (m) & 68.97 (8.42) & 74.23 (9.71) & 5.25 (3.97) ***\\
\hline
Tonnage (GT) & 1383.41 (533.56) & 1718.14 (653.38) & 334.73 (3.79) ***\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Effort redistribution}

We can compare the footprint of displaced and non-displaced vessels before and after the implementation of PIPA to better understand the effort redistribution. Non-displaced vessels serve as a control group that was not subject to a spatial closure but might have redistributed in response to changing environmental conditions, such as ENSO. The spatial redistribution patterns of displaced vessels relative to non-displaced vessels suggest that some relocated to other waters in Kiribati (\emph{i.e.} Gilbert islands and Line islands), but also the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru, and the high seas (Fig \ref{fig:fishing_raster_diff}).
