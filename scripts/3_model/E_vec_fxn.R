#' Effort allocation
#'
#' @description Given parameters (pi and X the most important ones),
#' this function calculates the effort for each patch. If efforts were to
#' be negative, a zero is returned instead.
#'
#' @param p Price per ton
#' @param q Catchability
#' @param Xvec Biomass vector
#' @param theta Movement parameter (between 0 and 1)
#' @param R Percent of patch as reserve (between 0 and 1)
#' @param pi Vessel day price
#' @param beta beta coefficient in costs
#' @param c costs
#'
#' @return a numeric vector of length Xvec containing the effort allocation to each parcel
