# Cost of a reserve is governed by fish movement

> Less movement leads to higer costs

This first par uses no trading, but allows us to look at how movement ($\theta$) governs costs. The intuition is that, given the parameterization, high movement rates will lead to low costs because:

$$\Omega = \theta + (1 - \theta)(1 - R)$$

This shows that, no matter what the size of the reserve is, when $\theta = 1$, $\Omega = 1$.

## Get initial conditions

We first run a model that allows for trading to get the Effort vector that would maximize $pi$.

```{r}
Benchmark_results <-
  PNA_with_trading(
    fvec = fvec,
    theta = theta,
    R = R,
    r = r,
    K = K,
    p = p,
    q = q,
    Xvec = Xvec,
    beta = beta,
    c = c,
    E = E
  ) %>%
  select(
    Country,
    b_harvest = Harvest,
    b_vessel_days = Vessel_Days,
    b_stock = Stock,
    b_stock_i = Stock_i,
    b_vdsprice = VDSprice,
    b_vdsrevenue = VDSrevenue,
    b_vdsrevenue_all = VDSrevenue_all,
    b_vdsrevenue_notKIR = VDSrevenue_notKIR
  )
```

We then take these results, and use the observed efforts as the optimal efforts.

```{r}
Evec <- Benchmark_results$b_vessel_days

Evec
```

## Run the model

We now run the model with **NO** trading, using the Evec above as starting condition.

```{r}
# Create an empty tibble to store the results in the process
Rvec <- seq(0, 1, 0.05)
thetavec <- seq(0, 1, 0.1)

DF_results_no_trading <-
  expand.grid(R = Rvec, theta = thetavec) %>%
  mutate(
    res = map2(
      theta,
      R,
      PNA_no_trading,
      fvec = fvec,
      r = r,
      K = K,
      p = p,
      q = q,
      Xvec = Xvec,
      beta = beta,
      c = c,
      Evec = Evec
    )
  ) %>%
  unnest()
```

We now take these results and add the benchmark results (no reserve) to calculate the cost of the reserve as the change in revenue. The proportional way of saying this is:

$$
\%C_R = \frac{\Pi_{R = 0} - \Pi_{R = r}}{\Pi_{R = 0}}
$$
Where $\Pi_{R = 0}$  is the vessel-day revenue when there is no reserve, hence the $R = 0$ subindex. The $\Pi_{R = r}$ denotes the vessel-day revenues when reserve has size ($r \in (0, 1)$). The vessel-day revenue is simply the vessel-day price times the number of vessel-days in patch $i$: $\pi \times E_i$.

```{r}
DF_1_no_trading <- DF_results_no_trading %>%
  filter(Country == "KIR") %>%
  left_join(Benchmark_results, by = "Country") %>%
  mutate(
    cost = b_vdsrevenue - VDSrevenue,
    rel_cost = cost / b_vdsrevenue
  )
```

We can now go ahead and plot these results. The figure below shows the $C_R$ defined above for different size of reserves $R$ in the x-axis, given values of $theta$ (colors). The graph shows how a smaller movement rate leads to increased costs to the country that implements the reserve. A movement of $\theta = 1$ implies no reserve, and thus leads to no losses. However, this parameter is unlikely. We also see how the losses are not proportional to 1. That is, a 10% closure does not lead to a 10% loss in profits.

**Is this due to the concavity in costs? i.e. the $\beta$ parameter$?**

Yes, it looks like a $\beta = 1.1$ actually reduces this.

  costs_no_trading_plot <-
    ggplot(data = DF_1_no_trading) +
    geom_line(aes(

      group = theta,
      color = theta
    ),

# Trading affects costs

> Trading reduces costs to implementing party

We now run the same model, with same initial conditions, but allow trading as a reserve is closed.

```{r}
DF_results_with_trading <-
  expand.grid(R = Rvec, theta = thetavec) %>%
  mutate(
    res = map2(
      theta,
      R,
      PNA_with_trading,
      fvec = fvec,
      r = r,
      K = K,
      p = p,
      q = q,
      Xvec = Xvec,
      beta = beta,
      c = c,
      E = E
    )
  ) %>%
  unnest()
```

Again, put it together with the reference values to calculate costs.

```{r}
DF_1_with_trading <- DF_results_with_trading %>%
  filter(Country == "KIR") %>%
  left_join(Benchmark_results, by = "Country") %>%
  mutate(
    vessel_days_sold = b_vessel_days - Vessel_Days,
    sales_revenue = vessel_days_sold * VDSprice,
    all_VDSrevenue = VDSrevenue + sales_revenue,
    cost = b_vdsrevenue - all_VDSrevenue,
    rel_cost = cost / b_vdsrevenue
  )
```

The following graph shows the same information as the graph above. However, in this case, the costs are significantly lower. This is because a party can sell it's original allocation to other parties. The reduction i

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}

    color = theta
  ),
  size = 1
  ) +

```


## Cost reduction due to trading

```{r}
shorter_no_trading <- DF_1_no_trading %>% 
  select(Country, R, theta, Vessel_Days, VDSprice, VDSrevenue, cost, rel_cost)

shorter_trading <- DF_1_with_trading %>% 
  select(Country, R, theta, Vessel_Days_trading = Vessel_Days, pi_trading = VDSprice, VDSrevenue_trading = VDSrevenue, cost_trading = cost, rel_cost_trading = rel_cost)

both <- left_join(shorter_no_trading, shorter_trading, by = c("Country", "R", "theta")) %>% 
  mutate(delta_cost = cost - cost_trading,
         rel_delta_cost = delta_cost / cost) %>% 
  filter(!R == 0,
         !theta == 1)
```


```{r}
(delta_costs_plot <- ggplot(data = both) +
  geom_line(aes(
    x = R,
    y = rel_delta_cost,
    group = theta,
    color = theta
  ),
  size = 1
  ) +
  xlab("Portion of patch as reserve (R)") +
  ylab("Costs avoided by trading") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  startR::ggtheme_plot() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme(legend.position = "None"))
```

All together

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 7}
(cost_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(costs_no_trading_plot,
                   costs_with_trading_plot,
                   delta_costs_plot, ncol = 1))
```

Now let's save this figure.

```{r}
ggsave(plot = cost_plot,
       filename = here("docs", "img", "cost_plot.pdf"), width = 4, height = 7)
```

# Allocation rules matter

We first obtain the optimal allocation by running the model until steady state and with no reserves.
