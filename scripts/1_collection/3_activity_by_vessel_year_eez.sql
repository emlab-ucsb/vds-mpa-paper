# This query gets different measures of fishing and activity
# for each of the 318 vessels that we are interested in.
# The query proceeds as follws:
# 1) Subquery of PNA EEz info
# 2) Subquery with activity by vessel for each PNA eez
# 3) Subquery with general activity by vessel for all eezs
# 4) Lookup table for all EEZs
# 5) Combine everything
